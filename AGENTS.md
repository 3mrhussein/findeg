## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

GitHub Issues via the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Default five canonical roles (`needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout (root `GLOSSARY.md` + `docs/adr/`) when those files exist. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Next.js version

`frontend/dashboard` and `frontend/storefront` pin a Next.js version newer than training data, with breaking API/convention changes. Before writing Next.js-specific code, read `node_modules/next/AGENTS.md` and the bundled docs it points to (`node_modules/next/dist/docs/`) rather than relying on memory.

### Branch naming

Branches follow `<type>/<kebab-case-slug>` (e.g. `feat/backend-feature-barrels`).
Types: `feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert`, plus `hotfix` for PRs into `main` only (its commits and PR title still use `fix:`).
PRs into `main` must come from `develop`, `hotfix/*` or `release-please--*`.
Exempt: `main`, `develop`, `release-please--*`, `dependabot/*`, `worktree-*`.
The pre-push hook and the CI `Branch policy` check share these rules from `scripts/ci-policy/policy.mjs`. See `docs/adr/0002-conventional-branch-and-commit-naming.md`.

# This is NOT the Turborepo you know

Turborepo configuration, task behavior, and CLI commands can vary between installed versions and may differ from your training data. Resolve the `turbo` package from this file's directory or relevant workspace; in monorepos, it may not be visible from the repository root. For example, run `node -p "require.resolve('turbo/package.json')"` from a workspace that depends on `turbo`.

Read `docs/README.md` inside that installed package first, then read the relevant pages from its `docs/` directory before changing Turborepo configuration or commands. Heed deprecation notices. These bundled docs match the installed package version and are available without network access.

This block is written and re-added by `turbo` before repository-scoped commands when an AI agent is detected. In the Turborepo source repository, its template is defined in `crates/turborepo-cli/src/cli/agent_guidance.rs`. Removing the managed block while updates are enabled means a later qualifying invocation will add it again. Set `"agentGuidance": false` in the root `turbo.json` or `turbo.jsonc` to opt out; this does not remove an existing block. Keep the block committed with your work to avoid an uncommitted change on the next agent invocation.
